Hi, I’m @AntoineC1990 a wet-lab molecular biologist.  
I can provide you insights in life science at the molecular & cellular level in a practical or theoretical way.   
Post-transcriptionnal regulations (RNA & DNA manipulation) and immunology (antibodies manipulation) are my main specialties. 

I want to become a dry scientist!  
I'll used this page to expose my dry work to critics & remarks.   
Please don't hesitate to help me improve my code!

I'm currently setting up my git...
